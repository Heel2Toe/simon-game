# Simon Game

This is a classic pattern memorising game. 

The game features four colored buttons that light up in a sequence. Players must replicate the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order. As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more challenging, testing the player's memory and concentration.

The project was made with Nextjs and Firebase, with Zustand for global state management.
